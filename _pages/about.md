### description
Urban environments are vibrant and ever-changing, with many intricate systems interplaying with one another. Understanding these systems is crucial for city planners, researchers, and policy-makers.

This workshop, organized by the Computational Social Team at ETH Zurich, delves deep into the realm of Data-Driven Agent-Based Models. 
It aims to bring together leading researchers who have developed agent-based models (ABMs) capturing specific facets of urban dynamics.

### objective
Urban environments are complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted. By combining insights from different ABMs – ranging from traffic and mobility to housing markets and labor dynamics – we aim to craft a comprehensive model that captures the intricacies of city life.
